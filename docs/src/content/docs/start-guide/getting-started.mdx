import { getConstantUrl, getUtilityUrl } from '../v2/getUrl';

This [package](https://github.com/mustib/mustib-utils) is a collection of utilities that I use in nearly every project.<br />
It was part of one of my learning projects, but since it became bigger, and I needed
it for multiple projects, I decided to move it to its own package.

For updates and new features, please refer to the **[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mustib/mustib-utils/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)** file in the GitHub repository to track all changes.

## Installation:

```bash
npm install @mustib/utils@latest
```

## Usage:

### Categories

- exports are divided into 3 categories:
  - **`/`** for common utilities that work in both **node** and **browser** environments
  - **`/node`** for **node** environments
  - **`/browser`** for **browser** environments

- each category exports a global <a target="_blank" href={`${getConstantUrl('index')}`}>constants</a> variables.

- common utilities can be imported from both **/node** and **/browser**

- all utilities are exported as **named exports** under their category

- both **ESM** and **CJS** are supported depending on your package manager configuration (e.g. `import` vs `require`)

```js
// common utilities
import { AppError } from '@mustib/utils';

// node utilities
import { EnvVars } from '@mustib/utils/node';

// browser utilities
import { getElementBoundaries } from '@mustib/utils/browser';
```

### Error Handling
each utility that might throw an error will use <a target="_blank" href={`${getUtilityUrl('common', 'apperror')}`}>AppError</a> class to manage and handle errors in an application. To help filter errors for both scopes: this utility and the library as a whole, each utility that throws errors will export an array of symbols called <a target="_blank" href={`${getUtilityUrl('common', 'apperror', 'errorscope')}`}>error scope</a> which includes the global <a target="_blank" href={`${getConstantUrl('LIBRARY_ERROR_SCOPE')}`}>LIBRARY_ERROR_SCOPE</a> constant.
  - the exported scopes name should start with the utility name with first letter in lowercase and then ErrorScope like this: `utilityNameErrorScope`
  - it will be stated at the top of each utility docs page the exported error scope variable name if it exports them

:::note[Important Note]
The exported scope array will also include the global
<a target="_blank" href={`${getConstantUrl('LIBRARY_ERROR_SCOPE')}`}>LIBRARY_ERROR_SCOPE</a> constant,
this is useful to filter errors for both scopes: this utility and the library as a whole,
and to only get errors for specific utility, you can use the `includesScope` and `excludesScope` options of <a target="_blank" href={`${getUtilityUrl('common', 'apperror', 'tostring')}`}>appError.toString()</a> method.
