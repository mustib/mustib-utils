This [package](https://github.com/mustib/mustib-utils) is a collection of utilities that I use in nearly every project.<br />
It was part of one of my learning projects, but since it became bigger, and I needed
it for multiple projects, I decided to move it to its own package.

For updates and new features, please refer to the **[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mustib/mustib-utils/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)** file in the GitHub repository to track all changes.

## Installation:

```bash
npm install @mustib/utils@latest
```

## Usage:

exports are divided into 3 categories:

- **`/`** for common utilities that work in both **node** and **browser** environments
- **`/node`** for **node** environments
- **`/browser`** for **browser** environments

```js
// common utilities
import { AppError } from '@mustib/utils';

// node utilities
import { EnvVars } from '@mustib/utils/node';

// browser utilities
import { getElementBoundaries } from '@mustib/utils/browser';
```

:::note
common utilities can be imported from both **/node** and **/browser**
:::
