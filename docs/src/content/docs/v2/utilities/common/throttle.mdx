The **`throttle`** function returns a throttled version of a function that, when invoked repeatedly, will only call the original function at most once every `ms` milliseconds.

The **`throttle`** function is used to limit the number of times a function is called within a short period of time, such as scroll events. This can significantly improve performance, especially if the function is expensive or computationally heavy.

## Usage
```ts
import { throttle } from '@mustib/utils';

const fn = throttle(() => {
  console.log('throttled')
}, 100)

fn();fn();fn(); // logs "throttled" once
```

## Definition
```ts
function throttle<T extends Func = Func>(func: T, ms = 100): T {}
```
